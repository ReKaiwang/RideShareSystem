\f1 :  
\f0 We find that the password of a users is not encrypted before being stored at database, which is dangerous because that it will be much easier for someone to figure the the password of a user.\
\
01/27: Fix the problem by encrypting the password \
\
01/27:  We find that if the user just enter the URL of the ride search page and other pages, he will access to this page even if he has not logged in. This is dangerous because that if someone has not logged make a request, the data will lose some required information.\
\
01/28: fix the problem by checking if user has been authorized or not. If the user has not logged in, he will not be able to access the ride request page and other pages.\
\
01/30: We find that a owner or a sharer can change the status of a ride. This should not be allowed because only driver can change that, and only in the order of open->confirm->finish. \
\
01/30: fix the problem by not allowing owner/sharer to change the status, and a driver could only change that in the correct order.\
\
01/31: In some page, like view status page, there is no button to go to other pages, which makes these pages dead end.\
\
01/31: fix this by adding \'93back\'94 button that will jump to other pages. \
\
02/01: The information of sharer cannot be showed in a ride. The reason is that there is no link between a ride and a sharer, the only link a ride have is with its owner.\
\
02/01: fix the problem by change the relationship between rides and users from \'93Foreignkey\'94 to \'93ManytoMany\'94; the link between driver and ride is also built. \
\
02/02: We find that every user could access to the search page (driver), this should not be allowed since a user who is not a driver can claim a ride. \
\
02/02: fix the problem by checking if the user is a driver. If the user is not a driver, he will not be able to access the search page.\
\
02/03: The formation of time is different according to the 
\f1 b
\f0 rowser a user use. Some of them is XX:XX, some of them is XX:XX am/pm, this is will lead to some error when load and store data.\
\
02/03: fix this problem by change the type of time (from time type to char type)\
\
02/05: A driver can claim his ride, and a owner/sharer can rejoin his ride unlimited times, this should not be allowed since it is unreasonable and will cause some further error.\
\
02/05: fix this problem by redesign the filter module that the search result of a user will not include his own rides.\
\
02/06: We find that our ride cancel module has some problem that a ride can be canceled for several times, and this will lead to the cancellation of other rides. This is dangerous because if a user cancel a ride multiple times, the database will become chaotic.\
\
02/06: We find that the cancellation problem can be avoid by clear the cache every time a user cancel a ride.\
